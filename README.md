Write a 5k!
======

A simple application that has some similarities to ficly.com.  You can write a story of up to five thousand characters (thus, "Write a 5k!"), and then create a sequel or prequel to any story.

I grabbed the skeleton from my [TodoMVC tutorial using Lineman](https://github.com/rwalters/TodoMVCLineman) application.

NOTES
-----
This is written in Ember with Lineman to precompile everything.

You have to follow the instructions on the [Lineman](https://github.com/testdouble/lineman) page set up Node.JS and other dependencies.  I have slightly modified the ```config/files.coffee``` to load the JavaScript and CoffeeScript files in the correct order.
